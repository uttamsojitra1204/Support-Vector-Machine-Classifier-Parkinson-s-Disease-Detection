# Support-Vector-Machine-Classifier-Parkinson-s-Disease-Detection

=> 🔧 Project Architecture

=> The project follows these steps:

1. Data Preprocessing:
- Handling missing values (if any)
- Normalizing the data for optimal SVM performance
- Splitting data into training and testing sets

2. Model Selection:
- Implementing SVM with various kernels (linear, RBF)
- Tuning hyperparameters (e.g., C, gamma)

3.Evaluation:
- Model performance evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

=> 📝 Conclusion
- The Support Vector Machine Classifier provides a robust solution for Parkinson’s disease detection, demonstrating the power of machine learning in healthcare. Further improvements and collaborations are welcome!
